2 Raylib Templates that use Zig.

*To clone: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MrBeelo/BeeloRaylibZigTemplates.git*

The first one uses the actual C version of raylib while the second one uses the zig bindings.

All of this thanks to 'Coding With Sphere'! (Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGlTuDmotnU&t=681s)

I've also included a makefile in each template to make compiling a bit easier, though you can skip using it if you want.

That's about it :)
